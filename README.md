# BMI Calculator

A simple **BMI Calculator** built using **Flutter** that allows users to calculate their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on their height and weight. It also features a **Syncfusion Radial Gauge** to visually represent the BMI value.

## Features
- **User-friendly UI** with input fields for Age, Height (feet & inches), and Weight.
- **BMI Calculation Formula:** Uses standard formula to calculate BMI.
- **Syncfusion Radial Gauge** to display BMI category.
- **Categorized BMI Ranges:**
  - **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5 (Blue)
  - **Normal Weight:** BMI 18.5 - 24.9 (Green)
  - **Overweight:** BMI 25 - 29.9 (Orange)
  - **Obese:** BMI 30+ (Red)
- **Error Handling:** Prevents division by zero and invalid inputs.
